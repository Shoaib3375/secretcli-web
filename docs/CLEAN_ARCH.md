# Clean Architecture

In a clean architecture for a Go application, the `handler (or controller)`, `use case (or service)`, and `repository` layers work together to manage the flow of data and business logic effectively. 

Hereâ€™s an explanation of usage_
## 1. Handler:

**Role:** The handler (or controller) is the entry point for incoming HTTP requests. It maps HTTP requests to application logic and formats HTTP responses.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Receive HTTP Requests:** Handlers listen for specific HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST) on defined routes.
- **Validate Input:** Handlers typically perform basic validation of request data (e.g., checking if required fields are present).
- **Delegate to Use Case/Service:** After processing the request data, the handler calls the appropriate use case/service method to perform business logic.
- **Format HTTP Responses:** Handlers format the responses back to the client, including success messages, data, or error messages.s


## 2. Use Case (Service)

**Role:** The use case (or service) layer contains the application's business logic. It orchestrates the operations between the handler and the repository.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Implement Business Logic:** The use case defines the core business rules, such as user registration, authentication, and other domain-specific operations.
- **Data Transformation:** It may transform data from the repository format to a format suitable for the handler (or vice versa).
- **Transaction Management:** The use case can manage transactions if multiple repository calls need to be atomic.
- **Error Handling:** It handles business-related errors and communicates them back to the handler.

## 3. Repository
**Role:** The repository layer is responsible for data persistence and retrieval. It abstracts the underlying data source (like a database) and provides a clean API for the use case/service.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Data Access:** It handles all interactions with the data source, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.
- **Data Mapping:** The repository may convert data between the application's domain model and the database model.
- **Encapsulate Data Logic:** It keeps data access logic encapsulated, allowing the use case/service layer to focus on business rules without worrying about the data source details.
